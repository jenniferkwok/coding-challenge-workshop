<li>Bootstrap is implemented for responsive design for the navbar and  main page content.</li>
	<li>I would like to use LESS or SASS in the future in order to make my code less redundant, as some colors are used repeatedly.</li>
	<li>There is no actual authentication function, however, an 'if-else' statement is written on client-side javascript to control whether 'login' or 'logout' is shown.</li>
